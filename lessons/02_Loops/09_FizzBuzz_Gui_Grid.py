"""Fizzbuzz Grid

We're going to use a Windowing library, guizero, to create a 10x10 grid of
numbers, with each number in a separate cell, but we're also going to set the
color of the number based on the following rules:

* If the number is evenly divisible by 5, print '🦡'
* If the number is evenly divisible by 3, print '🍄'
* If the number is evenly divisible by 15, print '🐍'
* If it is divisible by neither, print the number.

Additionally, If you are displaying a number  color the numbers as follows:

* If the sum of the digits of the number is even, color the number blue
* If the sum of the digits of the number is odd, color the number red

Here is how you can display a number in your grid. Call this function in your loop
to display the number in the grid cell at the row and column you specify.

    Text(app, text=str(number), grid=[col, row], color=color)

Or to display a badger: 
    
    Text(app, text='🦡', grid=[col, row], color=color)

HINT: You can use % and // to get the first and last digit of a number, 
our you can convert the number to a string and iterate over the digits

# Create a 10x10 grid using nested loops
for i in range (10):
    for j in range (1,11):
        num = i*10+j
        Text(app, text=str(num), grid=[j, i], color= 'black')
        if num%15 == 0:
            Text(app, text='🐍', grid=[j, i], color='white')
        elif num%3 == 0:
            Text(app, text='🍄', grid =[j,i], color='white')
        elif num%5 ==0:
            Text(app, text='🦡', grid=[j, i], color='white')
       
# Or you can use a single loop and calculate the row and column

# In the loop, calculate or increment the number

# Use % determing the display, using fizzbuzz rules

   
# If you are displaying a number, calculate the sum of the digits and determine the color

# Call Text(app, text='...', grid=[col, row], color=...) to display something. 

app.display()
